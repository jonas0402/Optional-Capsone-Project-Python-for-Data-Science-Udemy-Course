# Optional-Capsone-Project-Python-for-Data-Science-Udemy-Course
This is an optional capstone project from the "Python for Data Science' course at Udemy. This project was labeled as optional and it does a data analysis over financial stocks for a group of financial institutions. For this project, I used pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, and cufflinks to analyze and visualize the data. Unfortunately, the cufflinks library is not shown on Github, but what it does is that it creates interactive visualizations to slice and dice the data as desired without affecting the visualiztion code. There is nothing special but this is the way I show that I am learning.
